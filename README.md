Hi y'all. 
With the release of update 47, one of my favorite website with ESO tools TFB (taste for blood) was taken down. 
I sympathize with their reasoning for discontinuing their tools. ESO has had some interesting choices in its balance these last few updates.

This basic website is made for any player wanting to optimize their group's Crit DMG and Penetration. Currently that is the main scope of this project. 
I may be open to adding more to the site in the future. 
Please feel free to suggest any changes to the calculator or edit/use my code.
