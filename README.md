Hi y'all. 
With the release of update 47, one of my favorite website with ESO tools TFB (taste for blood) was taken down. 
I sympathize with their reasoning for discontinuing their tools. ESO has had some interesting choices in its balance these last few updates.
This website/app is an attempt to recreate a Crit DMG calculator.


Please feel free to suggest any changes to the calcular or edit/use my code.

Thanks to the folks over at TFB for being the inspiration for this tool. I hope to see the TFB community return in future. Thanks for all y'all did for the ESO community!
